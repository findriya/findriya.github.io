                <h2>Two Tips</h2>
                <article>
                <h3>Support System at Home</h3>
                <p>I couldn't have made it through my undergraduate program without the support of my children, my husband, my parents, family and friends.  There were times I wanted to quit, sometimes I'd take a quiz and call up my mom knowing full well I probably failed. She'd talk to me and tell me not to give up.</p>
                <p>Alaska Native Science & Engineering Program (ANSEP) was my home away from home and I had core study groups assigned and put together by the program. <br>It helped knowing I had a study group to work out problems I didn't understand.  It also forced me to make friends, something well, I've always had a hard time doing. I am not one with 20 to 30 friends, I have three or four real close friends, that I can pick up the phone and call after 2 weeks of not talking and feel like we just spoke yesterday.</p>

                <h3>Be Realistic About How Much You Can Handle</h3>
                <p>Being real on scholarship essays about my juggling mommy-hood, part-time work, and full-time school did help get me some extra funding early in my undergraduate degree program.  So there's something to be said about it.</p>
                <p>Also, I was reminded a couple of times when I was being all woe-me, I'm so tired that there are successful Alaska Native women from our region that had to work, go to school and be a mom as a single parent. My hats are off to those women!  Thank you for being great role models, you know who you are.</p>
